## About The App
Geocoding is an app that allows user to input a list of addresses (or csv file) and map the coordinates into a map and allows user to download the coordinates as a CSV file. 

## Technologies
I used `HTML`, `CSS`, `ReactJS`, `Bootstrap`

## Setup
- `git clone`the url to your terminal
- `cd geocoding` to the geocoding folder
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- add `.env` file to the root directory and add api key to access geosupport's api
